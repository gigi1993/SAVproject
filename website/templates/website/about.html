            <br>
            <p>
                We are a group of researchers of the Delft University of Technology (<a href="https://www.tudelft.nl" style="color: 159124;">TU Delft</a>), and we created this webpage to report the extent to which Autonomous Systems are vulnerable to IP Spoofing. IP Spoofing is a critical vulnerability in Internet architecture, often exploited by attackers to launch amplification and reflection DDoS attacks. To mitigate this threat, network operators can implement BCP38, a best common practice known as Source Address Validation.
                <br>
                Here, we report measuremets of compliance with BCP38 performed by CAIDA (see below), with the aim of spreading this information and increasing awareness about this problem in the public opinion.
                <br><br>
                Interested to learn more on IP Spoofing? You can start watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxN4zWTNSds" style="color: 159124;">this video</a> by CAIDA or reading <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/doc/addressing-challenge-ip-spoofing" style="color: 159124;">this publication</a> by the Internet Society (advanced).

            <br>
            <p>
                Differently from other network proprieties, the deployment of BCP38 is extreamly difficult to measure. So far, the most feasible way to test if a network performs source address validation is to try to send spoofed packets from that network, and evaluate if the operator properly filters its trafffic. <br> To this aim, the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis launched the <a href="https://www.caida.org/projects/spoofer/" style="color: 159124;">Spoofer Project</a>, provinding volunteers with an application that tests the network on which it runs. The availability of information on the networks allowing IP Spoofing is crucial to mitigatate the threat of DDoS attack, and the use of this application represents today the most reliable source.

            <p>Available for Windows, Mac and Linux systems, the application is very easy to install, and runs automatically without the need of special configurations.</p>
